This is an experimental academic paper with an interactive results section.

Dependencies:
  * jupyter notebooks must be installed on your system (I tested with version 4.4.0 from anaconda)

To participate in the experiment, clone either branch 'groupA' or 'groupB' and then:
  * go to presentatin/html
  * run ./launchJupyter.sh
  * open pfa.html in your browser (on osx, simply "open pfa.html").
  * fill out the google form: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSejpFmQSuCUmJhgT4Z97rSsmw28dz_5T2R6Bg3FKsYymcIeUw/viewform?usp=sf_link
    * I recommend filling out the form as you read the results section of the paper
  * OPTIONAL: If you have software for it and don't mind, I would appreciate a video (screen cap) of you interacting with the paper.

Notes:
This was tested on OSX with Chrome and Jupyter version 4.4.0. I make no
promises about it working on other platforms.
